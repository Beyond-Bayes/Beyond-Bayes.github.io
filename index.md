## Abstract
A long-standing objective of AI research has been to discover theories of reasoning that are general: accommodating various forms of knowledge and applicable across a diversity of domains. The last two decades have brought steady advances toward this goal, notably in the form of mature theories of probabilistic and causal inference, and in the explosion of reasoning methods built upon the deep learning revolution. However, these advances have only further exposed gaps in both our basic understanding of reasoning and in limitations in the flexibility and composability of automated reasoning technologies. 

This workshop aims to reinvigorate work on the grand challenge of developing a computational foundation for reasoning in minds, brains, and machines. Goals include:

- Developing a richer shared conceptual and mathematical vocabulary between researchers in neuroscience, cognitive science, Bayesian and causal inference, machine learning, logic, programming languages, and automated reasoning

- Advancing novel knowledge representations and inference algorithms that are qualitatively more general and expressive than the current state of the art, even if they are currently less efficient or less familiar within the ML community

- Exposing and formalizing modes of reasoning that are novel or underexplored within the ML community, and ultimately implementing them in software

- Predicting what lies beyond the current languages and algorithms for reasoning, and pinpointing algorithmic and conceptual roadblocks that must be overcome

## Topics

Specific topics relevant to these larger goals include:

- Cognitive science of formal and intuitive reasoning

- Plausible cognitive neuroscientific foundations for general reasoning systems 

- Machine learning approaches to theorem proving and deductive reasoning

- The semantics of natural language reasoning with large language models

- Design and implementation of probabilistic & differentiable programming languages

- Advances in formal languages and implementations for formalizing mathematics

- Algorithms and representations for causal and counterfactual reasoning

- Causal queries beyond counterfactuals, e.g. actual causality & causal explanation

- Insights from algorithms and representations in modern SAT and SMT solvers

- Unifying semantic and algorithmic frameworks for distinct forms of reasoning

# Call for Submissions

 *Note: date in OpenReview will be corrected to May 16*
 
We seek submissions related to any of the topics in the overview, especially ongoing or preliminary work that bridges gaps between topics, and work that might be unfamiliar to the broader ICML community. Submissions will be lightly reviewed for relevance and clarity. All accepted submissions will be presented as posters at a poster session, and a subset will also be selected for oral presentation as contributed talks.  Talks will be selected to generate interesting discussions -- speculative/perspective abstracts welcome.

**Submissions are due in [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2022/Workshop/Beyond_Bayes) by midnight AoE on May 16, 2022** and may take one of two forms:

1. **Extended Abstracts**: Authors may submit ongoing or preliminary work in the form of an extended abstract of 2-4 pages (excluding references or appendices, preference for shorter abstracts) for consideration for a poster presentation. Submissions should be anonymized and formatted in the [ICML style](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2022/CallForPapers). Abstracts are non-archival, but will be publicly posted on the workshop website if accepted.
2. **Syndicated Submissions**: Authors may also submit recent work that has been accepted for publication in another venue within the last 12 months of the deadline for consideration for a poster presentation. To encourage broad participation, preference will be given to work on topics that might be less familiar to the ICML community. Syndicated submissions can be in their original format, have no length requirement, and do not need to be anonymized. They are also non-archival, but will be posted publicly on the workshop website if accepted.

To stimulate discussion and interaction, poster presentations will be entirely in-person absent any further changes from the ICML conference chairs. Some need-based funding for travel and registration for speakers and poster presenters may be available from the workshop’s sponsors.

Joshua Tenenbaum is Professor of Computational Cognitive Science at MIT in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM). His long-term goal is to reverse-engineer intelligence in the human mind and brain, and to use these insights to engineer more human-like machine intelligence. In cognitive science, he is best known for developing theories of cognition as probabilistic inference in structured generative models, and applications to concept learning, causal reasoning, language acquisition, visual perception, intuitive physics, and theory of mind. In AI, he and his group have developed widely used models for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, probabilistic programming, and Bayesian unsupervised learning and structure discovery. His current research focuses on common-sense scene understanding and action planning, the development of common sense in infants and young children, and learning through probabilistic program induction and neuro-symbolic program synthesis. His work has been published in many leading journals and recognized with awards at conferences in Cognitive Science, Computer Vision, Neural Information Processing Systems, Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making, and Robotics. He is the recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contributions in Psychology from the American Psychological Association (2008), the Troland Research Award from the National Academy of Sciences (2011), the Howard Crosby Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists (2016), the R&D Magazine Innovator of the Year award (2018), and a MacArthur Fellowship (2019).

### [Jan-Willem van de Meent](https://jwvdm.github.io/) *(tentatively confirmed)* 

Jan-Willem van de Meent is an Associate Professor (Universitair Hoofddocent) at the University of Amsterdam, where he co-directs the AMLab with Max Welling. He is also an Assistant Professor (on leave) at Northeastern University, where he continues to advise and collaborate. His research develops models for artificial intelligence by combining probabilistic programming and deep learning. His group's work seeks to understand what inductive biases can enable models to generalize from limited data. These inductive biases can take the form of a simulator that incorporates knowledge of an underlying physical system, causal structure, or symmetries of the underlying domain. They combine model development with research on methods for inference in these models. They also put this work into practice in collaborations with researchers in robotics, NLP, healthcare, and the physical sciences. The technical backbone in much of his group's work is probabilistic programming. He is one of the creators of Anglican, a probabilistic language based on Clojure. His group currently develops Probabilistic Torch, a library for deep generative models that extends PyTorch. He is writing a book on probabilistic programming, a draft of which is available on arXiv. He is also a co-chair of the international conference on probabilistic programming (PROBPROG).

### [Nan Rosemary Ke](https://nke001.github.io/)
Rosemary is a research scientist at Deepmind. Previously, she was a PhD student at Mila, advised by Yoshua Bengio and Chris Pal. Her research centers around developing novel machine learning algorithms that can generalize well to changing environments. Her research focuses on two key ingredients: credit assignment and causal learning. These two ingredients flow into and reinforce each other: appropriate credit assignment can help a model refine itself only at relevant causal variables, while a model that comprehends causality sufficiently well can reason about the connections between causal variables and the effect of intervening on them. She has co-organized a conference, 6 workshops and 3 challenges. These are the conference on causal learning and reasoning (CLeaR) 2022, the “inductive biases, invariances and generalization in reinforcement learning” workshop at ICML 2020, “causal learning for decision making” workshop at ICLR2020, “efficient credit assignment workshop” at ICML 2018, “reproducibility in machine learning” at ICML 2017, ICML 2018 and ICLR 2019), the “Real robot challenge” at NeurIPS 2021 and the ICLR reproducibility challenge at ICLR 2018 and ICLR 2019.
