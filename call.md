## Call for submissions

We seek submissions related to any of the topics in the overview, especially ongoing or preliminary work that bridges gaps between topics, and work that might be unfamiliar to the broader ICML community. Submissions will be lightly reviewed for relevance and clarity. All accepted submissions will be presented as posters at a poster session, and a subset will also be selected for oral presentation as contributed talks.

Submissions are due in **OpenReview** by **midnight on May 13, 2022 (AoE)** and may take one of two forms:

1. **Extended Abstracts**: Authors may submit ongoing or preliminary work in the form of an extended abstract of 2-3 pages (excluding references or appendices) for consideration for a poster presentation. Submissions should be anonymized and formatted in the [ICML style](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2022/CallForPapers). Abstracts are non-archival, but will be publicly posted on the workshop website if accepted.
2. **Syndicated Submissions**: Authors may also submit recent work that has been accepted for publication in another venue within the last 12 months of the deadline for consideration for a poster presentation. To encourage broad participation, preference will be given to work on topics that might be less familiar to the ICML community. Syndicated submissions can be in their original format, have no length requirement, and do not need to be anonymized. They are also non-archival, but will be posted publicly on the workshop website if accepted.

To stimulate discussion and interaction, poster presentations will be entirely in-person absent any further changes from the ICML conference chairs. Some need-based funding for travel and registration for speakers and poster presenters may be available from the workshopâ€™s sponsors.
